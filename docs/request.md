# Request file

Request file is a simple [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) file with all request parameters. Depending on the request, some parameters could be optional. A typical request file might look like this:

{% raw %}
```toml
# "request" section is mandatory for each request
[request]
# Environment variables can be used everywhere in this file,
# they are replaced before processing.
# They should be defined like this: {{variable_name}}

# URL to call. Optional parameter.
url = 'http://httpbin.org/post'
# This is how it looks like with the environment variable:
# url = '{{base_url}}'

# Method, should be one of [OPTIONS,HEAD,POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE].
# Mandatory parameter
method = 'POST'

# Request timeout, ms. Optional parameter
timeout = 2000

# Maximum number of redirects, default is 30.
# Zero means no redirects are allowed
max_redirects = 0

# The request is considered to be OK if either the response code
# or the exception are specified in the array. Optional field.
# If not specified then all requests without exception will be
# considered as "passed"
expected_status = [200, "TooManyRedirects"]

# Sessions are disabled unless asked explicitly
# Any request in the chain that doesn't have "session" option
# or that have "session" set to false will break the session
session = false

# "auth" secion is optional
[auth]
# Basic auth example
basic.username = "admin"
basic.password = "TeMp0r@rY_Pas$w0rd"

# Digest auth
#digest.username = "admin"
#digest.password = "TeMp0r@rY_Pas$w0rd"

[headers]
# According to HTTP specification header names are case-insensitive
# Internally we convert them to Pascal-Case, for example:
# "cOnTeNt-tYpE" --> "Content-Type"
# The value remains case-sensitive
cOnTeNt-tYpE = "application/json; charset=utf-8"

[body]
# Body type, either "text" or "multipart"
type = "text"
# This is a simple text body
text = '''
{
    "valid": true,
    "value": 3755399308445874391,
    "status": "This Is A String"
}
'''
# All multipart sections should have names starting with "multipart-",
# followed by a number. Numbers start from 1 and should be contiguous
[multipart-1]
# This example adds a normal key/value part
name = "json_data"
data = '''{
    "id": 10325,
    "value": 56532,
    "status": "Invalid data"
}'''
[multipart-2]
# This example adds the file from the file system
name = "file_data"
filename = "data.zip"
[multipart-3]
# This creates a "virtual" file. The file doesn't exist
# on the file system, but will be sent as such
name = "virtual_file"
filename = "virtual.txt"
data = '''Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,

[scripts]
# This section has two scripts: pre-request and post-request
# pre-request script has access to:
#     - req (HttpRequest object)
#     - EnvVars (Dictionary with var_name:var_value pairs)
#     - AppLogger - log custom messages and test results
#     - @test_case decorator for the test case functions
#           see examples below
# post-request script has access to the same set of objects,
# as well as to:
#     - res (HttpResponse object)

# These test cases will be executed before sending the request

# For example, we test some pre-requisites ....
